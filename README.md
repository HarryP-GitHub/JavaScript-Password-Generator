# JavaSCript-Password-Generator

## Description

This project was to modify the JavaScript for a password Generator that would help employees generate random passwords based on the criteria they select. The app has a responsive user interface done by edX Boot Camps. Using JavaScript, specifically functions, if statements and for loops I made a functional password generator that will randomly generate a password for an employee based off their selected criteria so they will have a strong password for better security. 

## Installation

## Usage

Click the 'Generate Password' button to begin. It will prompt you to enter a number including and between 8 and 128, deciding the amount of characters within your password. Then you will be prompted to answer OK (Yes) / Cancel (No) to choose to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. Once you have decided your passwords criteria, your password will be generated and printed in the box.
I decided to leave in console.log to help understand the process of the password generation, so please look at the console to help understand these stages in the password generation.
